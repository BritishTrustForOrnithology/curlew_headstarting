After 10 min was walking fine in back of pen, though not as relaxed as 0E after same period. Also was quite stressed in hand towards end of tag fitting, suddenly started gaping (despite fitting process being much quicker than 0E). After 20 min, it was very happy and behaving as all other birds in the pen. Tag photos NAC.",
