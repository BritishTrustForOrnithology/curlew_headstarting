Possible power line fatality and subsequently scavenged. bird was predated between 1530-1600 yesterday, 7th July. It was predated AT the location where it was found, not carried there from elsewhere. It went to this spot around 45 minutes before the predation event, at 1445. It was along the edge of the field at 1430. Whatever predated it then spent about 3 hours playing with the carcass, presumably plucking it, before leaving it at 1845, which is when the accelerometer data flatlines. Tag redeployed on 3K"
