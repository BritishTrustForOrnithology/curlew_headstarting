The main habitats are hay meadows on drained peat and moorsh soils with a small proportion of pastures. Arable fields single or not present. Soil moisture varies during the breeding season and can vary between years (dry and wet years). The highest moisture of soil is at the beginning of the breeding season in April when grassland may be partially flooded. At the time of release, the grassland and ditches tend to be dry or moderately wet."
